# Visit Ireland
Visit Ireland is a website where you can learn a little more about the Emerald Isle. There are many places to be visited, known and appreciated by people of all ages.
In order to improve their English as a second language, many students choose Ireland as the place for their studies.

For that reason, I would like to make it easier for you to find places where students, tourists and residents can enjoy themselves.

By looking at the navigation bar you noticed that there are 3 possibilities:
home;
discovery;
castles
These 3 features were placed to facilitate navigation through the website.

By clicking on each of the cards, you will be directed to a specific page with the chosen subject: parks, coasts, pubs or museums.

![castles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31260554/215305448-1942eb3a-c811-449d-af59-9c6115523f65.jpg)

Castles are in a separete box, but it follows the same method than the others. By clicking at "read more" You will be directed to a castle page where you could find more information about castles in Ireland.

# Conclusion

I had a little trouble making the site look good. I'll be working on the next few days to perfect the beauty of the system by adding more movement, improving the colors, fixing the bugs and, who knows, using a more modern layout.
