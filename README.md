# Visit Ireland
Visit Ireland is a website where you can learn a little more about the Emerald Isle. There are many places to be visited, known and appreciated by people of all ages.
In order to improve their English as a second language, many students choose Ireland as the place for their studies.

For that reason, I would like to make it easier for you to find places where students, tourists and residents can enjoy themselves.

By looking at the navigation bar you noticed that there are 3 possibilities:

These 3 features were placed to facilitate navigation through the website.
